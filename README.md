# Musical Notes Trainer

This app helps you hit your notes on the saxophone faster and more accurately.

It trains you on the keys of a scale that you select. Start by selecting the key you want to train on, select the scale and the speed (up to 5 notes per second), then click `Start`.

If you want to change any of the parameters, make sure stop the trainer before doing that by clicking `Stop`.

New scales will be added from time to time.
